# TSP-Pathfinding
This travelling salesman problem is slightly altered with these changes:
The salesman can visit the same city multiple times if it leads to a better solution.
If a road exists from A to B, that doesn't mean a road from B to A exists.
Data for cities is from an excel spreadsheet.
Solved using these algorithms
- Greedy algorithm, chooses the best possible choice from current city
- Branch and Bound algorithm
- Genetic algorithm tournament
